## How do I install the General SPARQL app?

The easiest way to get the app is simply from the Cytoscape App manager. Just install [Cytoscape](http://cytoscape.org/) (3.0 or higher), start it, and go to menu->Apps->App Manager and search for “General SPARQL”. Or download it from the [app store website](http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/generalsparql).
