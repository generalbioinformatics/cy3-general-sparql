# Introduction

The General SPARQL app lets you navigate the semantic web using an intuitive interface. The app is pre-configured to visualise public data from Reactome, Uniprot, HGNC, NCBI Taxonomy, Chembl and more. The app uses federated SPARQL queries in the back-end, which can be customized and extended. It can be made to work with any public or private RDF resource. 

The General SPARQL app is completely new way to present data from triplestores.
